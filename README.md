# hello-world
My first GitHub repository

Every time I learn a new programming language, it's always this "Hello world" start. Now I repeat it on my first GitHub repository. 
Give you a brief introduce of myself.
When I was at College, I was abstracted by the C language and engaged in it for a long time. But unfortunately, I have never become an expert on it since then.
Last year, I came across with Python and was attracted by its simplicity and powerful use. It's a great language and I'm still learning new things now. I want to make some changes in my life this time using Python.
Hope that I can do some project on GitHub, make friends with people who share the same hobbies on programming.
Wish a better world.
